# SharedHaploDistPy
Compute Shared Haplogroup Distance (SHD) and associated p-values.
This distance method to be used in population genetics with frequencies of mitochondrial haplogroups were published by Nepar√°czki et al. (2018) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205920)

### SHD computation examples:
this will create 2 new files with computed distance and their p-values created by 10000 permutation steps:
SHDoutput_pvals.csv and SHDoutput_dist.csv

`
python SharedHaploDistPy.py -i SHD_example_input.csv -s ';' -p 1000 -o SHDoutput
